In this folder, it will be presented the analysis of a Kaggle competition, consisting of the creation of a predicting model for load forecasting. This analysis Will go from finding its elements, finding the reltaionship of said elements making the grafic model of the system. After that, the sensibility and complexity analysis is going to be explained, and finally the chaos and randomness will be shown

## Content

Inside this Repository there will be presented two different files:

1. _workshop__1_: Inside this PDF file, the said analysis in the introduction is going to be presented. The file is made in latex, as well as presented in a IEEE design
2. _system_model_: This file contains the model of the system, as well as in the PDF file. However, due to the small presentation inside the PDF, it will be given here
